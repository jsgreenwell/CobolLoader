You read the title right - intro to text parsing and difference between positional (string, array loops) and regex parsering of text. 
With some standard CSV used to explain packaging (and the creation of libarys).

Needs some gramer fixs and comments added (used in school project to alow students to learn Git/Github).

Used as a teaching example of regex with Java - not meant as efficient model (its not).
